My process

Built using :

- CSS grid
- CSS properties
- Simple HTML semantic

 This was my first project, and even if the results are not totally what I was expecting, I'm still proud of it !
So, through the process I have learning about how it can take some times to write a proper code and how we need to be aware of what properties ( especially CSS properties) we use in order to do the stuff we wants.

 I have learned to use : Grid box & place-items to center the contents inside of a div / Use margin to center a div / ( How it's difficult to find a font-family :) ) and sompe other handy stuff.
  
(PS : I'm not a native english speaker so my english can be a bit weird, I try my best, if you notice some mistakes, please, say me ! )

Continued development :

  I need to find some other ways to center a div ( it was very though ) and to write my code faster, perhaps with times it will becomme easier for
At this moment, all I need is to build more projects ( when i have the time ) to increase my front-end skills.

Useful ressources :
